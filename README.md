# blinqpay

Used a simple mvc folder structure for the task.

used a page approach but instead worked with tabs to avoid different screen navigation and for simplicity.

created my reusable components, connected my application to firebase using the credentials provided.

Also implemented a simple dark mode/light mode functionality where the colors would be selected by me and not letting the code do it for me. Did this because i was already making use if custom colors class. 

Added an internet connectivity checker also to detect if the device has no internet connection to avoid unnecessary errors.

use the link below to download the already built apk for testing.
