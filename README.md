# blinqpay

Used a simple mvc folder structure for the task.

used a page approach but instead worked with tabs to avoid different screen navigation and for simplicity.

created my reusable components, connected my application to firebase using the credentials provided.

Also implemented a simple dark mode/light mode functionality where the colors would be selected by me and not letting the code do it for me. Did this because i was already making use if custom colors class. 

Added an internet connectivity checker also to detect if the device has no internet connection to avoid unnecessary errors.
